General introduction for this article

**Important Information : This is just a basic set up for my personal blog. I will add more function later like multlanguage, comment, SEO and file classification etc.**

I might include multi language to this site!

## More Function 

1. As I just started using Gatsby I will add more function slowly. 
2. Most of time I will share my learning journey 
3. At the moment I have quiet few projects in my mind and I really want to try them.
